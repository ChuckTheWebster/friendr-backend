- [] Login/authentication is required
- [] Users are required to complete a profile that includes hobbies, interests, and a location (zip code), and friend radius
- [] Users can optionally upload photos (Images are stored to Amazon S3, not in the database)
- [] Users should be shown other users (hobbies, interests, pics) whose location is within friend radius
- [] User can select yes or no for each user shown to indicate a potential friend match
- [] Once a user says yes or no to another shown user, they should not see this user again
- [] If two users both say yes for friend match, they should be able to message each other




Plan:
- Have to finish implementing our models
- Work on the login (Flask-Login), registration, and authentication (JWT tokens)
    - Registration - upload profile pic
-
